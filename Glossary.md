Values are raw data. Times, dates, money, tuples, tags, URLs, files, email addresses, strings, arrays, numbers, coordinate pairs, and base64 encoded strings are values.

Values and words are grouped together in blocks. 

A variable can be used to hold any type of value. Variables only have meaning within the context where they are defined. A context can span the entire program or be restricted to a particular block, object, or function. 

An object is a group of variables which have values in a specific context. Objects are used for managing data structures which have more complex behavior. For instance, a bank account can benefit from using an object to specify its attributes and functions

A function is a block which has local variables that are given new values each time the block is evaluated. The local variables are the arguments of the function. Functions can be created in several ways.

A message is simply a file of text that is sent from one place to another.

Dialects are blocks that carry condensed meaning through the use of a different grammar (ordering) of values and words. Dialect require a parser to translate them into words and values. Dialects are usually unique and well-suited to the problems they are designed to solve. For instance, the list of arguments to a function is a dialect.

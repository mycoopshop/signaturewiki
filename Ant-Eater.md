>In animal societies, self-organization is the theory of how minimal complexity in the individual can generate greater complexity at the population. The rules specifying the interactions among the components in the system are implemented by using only local information without global information. In the study of social evolution, army ant performs altruism as one behavior of complexities, where each individual reduces its own fitness but increases the fitness of other individuals in the population. Such behaviors seem to be involved acts of self-sacrifice in order to aid the others. In evolutionary biology, such a behavior is called reciprocal altruism. The concept was initially developed to explain the evolution of cooperation as mutually altruistic acts (Trivers 1971). The basic idea is close to the strategy of “equivalent relation” in the study of strategic decision making.

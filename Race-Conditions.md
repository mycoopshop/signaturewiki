Non-preemptive multitasking means that when two function calls have the same priority, one call needs to return a dynamic proxy that if accessed, blocks until the value returns

Shared nothing multitasking means that processes are isolated from one another, share no mutable state, and a failure in one process cannot affect another process in an unstructured way.

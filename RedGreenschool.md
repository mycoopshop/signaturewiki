Re: Notice of Intent to Vacate Unit 5016

Dear Amador Village Apartment Managers,

This letter constitutes our written 30-day notice of our intent to vacate our apartment on November 30, 2018. Per the instructions outlined in the Early Lease Break Addendum, we have enclosed a cashierâ€™s check in the amount of $5,578, which is the equivalent of two months of our current rental rate. We have also enclosed a check in the amount of $2,995.26 to cover our November 2018 balance. 

Below is our new contact information, where you can send our security deposit, or reach us for any reason after November 30th. We have enjoyed our stay at Amador Village, and wish all of the staff a wonderful holiday season. 

Sincerely,



Paul and Halima Sweatte

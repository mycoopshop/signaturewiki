Parallel is for splitting calculations across multiple instances of a compiler or interpreter by spawning processes within a loop(https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Parallel_calculations#Racket, https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A97630_01/server.920/a96524/c20paral.htm, https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/01/07/increasing-slow-query-performance-with-parallel-query-execution/)

Concurrent is for time sharing by not waiting for the result of one line of code while executing subsequent lines of code (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/ThreadMigration/ThreadMigration.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008091-CH105-SW1)

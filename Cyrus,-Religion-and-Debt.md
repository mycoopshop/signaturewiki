>The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.

>Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.

>The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their "Redeemer." Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different form.

>The old and young live equally; there is no ruler, nor minister. The men and women ramble together; there is no matchmaker, nor en-gagement.

>Social expenditures are more urgent even than debts.
 
>The only relation that remains is 
friendship. There is no family, so that there is no inheri- 
tance, no private property, no selfish scheme. There is no 
class, so that the only classification is made either by age 
or by sex ; but whether old, middle-aged, or young, whether 
man or woman, each satisfies his needs. The Great Prin- 
ciple of the Great Similarity prevails, so that everyone is 
naturally as good as every one else and the distinction of the 
five moral constants is gone. Each has only natural love 
toward others, regardless of artificial rites and justice.

BICEP STRETCH
Stand facing a wall (about 6 inches away from the wall). Raise your arm out to your side and place the thumb side of your hand against the wall (palm down). Keep your elbow straight. Rotate your body in the opposite direction of the raised arm until you feel a stretch in your biceps. Hold 15 seconds, repeat 3 times.

FOREARM STRETCH
Keeping your elbow straight, bend your wrist down using your other hand until you feel a mild to moderate stretch pain-free (figure 7). Hold for 15 seconds and repeat 4 times.
Keeping your elbow straight, bend your wrist and fingers backwards using your other hand until you feel a mild to moderate stretch pain free. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat 4 times.

ELBOW STRETCH
Slowly bend your wrist forward and backward with your fist loosely clenched - if you clench too hard, you won't get an effective stretch of your forearm muscles. As your wrist bends back and forth, the downward pressure from your fingertips should help to loosen up the hypertonic muscles in your elbow region.

SHOULDER STRETCH
Squeeze your shoulder blades together as hard and far as possible pain-free. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times.

LAT STRETCH
Place one hand behind your neck. Gently push that elbow backwards so your hand moves further down your spine until you feel a mild to moderate stretch pain free. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat 4 times. Then repeat the exercise on the opposite side. This exercise can be progressed by incorporating a side bend of the trunk to the opposite side of the arm being stretched.

RHOMBOID STRETCH
Gently take your arm across your body using your other arm to take it a little further. Hold at a mild to moderate stretch pain free for 15 seconds and repeat 4 times on each arm.

AB STRETCH
Begin in sitting with your feet together and back straight. Using your elbows, gently push your knees down towards the floor until you feel a stretch in the groin. Hold for 15 seconds, 4 times at a mild to moderate stretch pain-free.
